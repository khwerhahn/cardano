# Cardano

This is work in progress (under heavy construction). Please feel free to participate.

## Goal:
Build a setup of containers for all flavours (k8s, docker swarm, docker....) so that you can host and build it where every you want and to start staking (when released).

Make it as easy as possible for everybody to participate and setup Cardano on their own machines.

## Containers
- Cardano SL
- Daedalus Wallet (WIP)
- Monitoring App (custom app to interact with Cardano) (WIP)

## Kubernetes (k8s) (WIP):
In the k8s folder are the `.yaml` definitions of setting up the containers.

## Docker Compose (WIP)

## Cloud Platforms
In the folder `cloud-platforms` are the setup scripts and/or guides.
### Google Cloud Engines (WIP)
in the `google-cloud` directory you will find the build script (and cleanup script) to create a kubernetes cluster to run cardano.
### AWS (WIP)
Not started yet

## Thanks
Thanks to IOHK and the whole Cardano team for setting new standards within the crypto space!
